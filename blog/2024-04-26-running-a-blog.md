Here's a quick explanation on why I decided to open my own blog, and how I manage it.

I will update it throughout the journey to keep you updated!

## Motivation

If you're considering creating your own blog, I'd encourage you to do so!

It's quite simple to do, and has some real advantages -

- You own your content, and can manage it in git.
- Your domain will gain popularity through SEO.
  - The older your domain and the more links it gets, the higher the SEO score.
  - â†’ The quicker you start, the more your domain will be indexed.
- Helps attract clients as a contractor.

## Stack

The stack I use for the blog is quite simple -

- Domain - You can buy your domain wherever you prefer, I chose GoDaddy because they had the lowest price for my domain.
- [Docosaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - A facebook open-source for managing docs and blogs
- GitHub repository
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) - Free CI/CD and global CDN
